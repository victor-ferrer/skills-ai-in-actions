_Congratulations! You've completed this exercise and learned how to integrate AI capabilities into GitHub Actions workflows using GitHub Models._

Here's a recap of your accomplishments:

- Created your first AI-powered GitHub Actions workflow using the `actions/ai-inference` action
- Built an intelligent workflow that automatically responds to new issues with AI-generated feedback
- Integrated multiple actions to create end-to-end automation that combines AI with traditional GitHub Actions

### What's next?

- Take another GitHub Skills exercise on [GitHub Learn](https://learn.github.com/skills)
- Browse the [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions) to discover actions that complement `ai-inference` and build more sophisticated AI-powered workflows
- Take a look at other, real world usage examples that are available in the [github-samples/models-in-actions](https://github.com/github-samples/models-in-actions) repository
